## Summary of Nanoleaf Initialization Fixes

I've made several improvements to fix the Nanoleaf controller initialization issues after restart:

### Problem Analysis

The issue was that after restart, even with saved authentication tokens, the Nanoleaf controller wasn't fully initializing because:

1. Initial connection tests could fail due to network timing
2. Panel layout wasn't being retrieved if initial auth failed
3. The system would fall back to solid color mode instead of per-panel distribution

### Changes Made

#### 1. NanoleafController.cpp - Improved Initialize Method

- **More resilient authentication**: Even if initial connection test fails, mark as authenticated if we have a saved token
- **Better error handling**: Keep tokens and retry rather than failing completely
- **Improved logging**: More detailed debug information about initialization steps

#### 2. NanoleafController.cpp - Enhanced displayPalette Method

- **On-demand panel layout**: If panel count is 0, automatically try to retrieve panel layout
- **Graceful fallback**: Falls back to solid color only if panel layout retrieval fails
- **Better debugging**: More detailed logging about panel distribution decisions

#### 3. NanoleafController.cpp - Filter Controller Panels

- **Fixed panel filtering**: Now properly excludes controller panels (shapeType 12) from color distribution
- **Accurate panel counts**: Only counts actual display panels that can show colors
- **Detailed logging**: Shows which panels are being filtered out and why

#### 4. LightManager.cpp - Improved Startup Flow

- **Automatic authentication**: For saved configurations, attempt immediate authentication during startup
- **Better status reporting**: More detailed logging about authentication status
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues to work even if initial auth fails

### Expected Behavior After Changes

1. **On First Setup**: Normal authentication flow, saves tokens and panel layout
2. **On Restart**:
   - Loads saved configuration including auth token
   - Attempts immediate connection validation
   - If successful: Gets panel layout and is ready for color display
   - If connection fails: Keeps token and retries on first palette request
3. **Color Display**:
   - Automatically distributes colors across actual display panels (excluding controller)
   - Falls back to solid color only if panel layout cannot be retrieved
   - Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting

### How to Test

1. Set up Nanoleaf normally (should work as before)
2. Restart the ESP32 controller
3. Send a color palette from the app
4. Check serial logs for initialization details
5. Verify that colors are distributed across individual panels

The controller should now properly initialize on restart without requiring re-authentication, and should distribute colors correctly across only the display panels.
